      <h4>
        Iâ€™ve been hacking and troubleshooting computers since Junior High. I get a special kick out of piecing things together and solving complex problems. I now spend most of my time building full-stack web applications.
        I have hours of self-teaching, several college CS courses and advanced professional training under my belt.

      <h4>
        Some of the skills that I have learned how to use are:
      </h4>
      <h4>Ruby on Rails, Javascript, Backbone, SQL, Git, HTML, and CSS</h4>
      <h4>Please check out some of my projects and let me know what you think through the contact page. Thanks again for stopping by.</h4>
