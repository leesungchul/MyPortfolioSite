				<h4>This application is an original project created by myself in about two weeks. It was created to solve the problem of planning events with a large group of people without the need for long e-mail threads or group text messages.
				</h4>
				<h4>
          This application allows for users to find and add friends and create and add locations to their favorites.
          Then they are able to create events with a suggested location, start time and end time, and a deadline for voting.
          Invited users can then invite more users and/or add more location/start time/end time suggestions and vote on them until the deadline is reached.
          At the deadline, voting is locked, and the event's information is set. Time circles countdown to the deadline and then the start time. When the event is over,
          The event is moved to the past events timeline. Pictures can be added to each event and location page which can also be viewed in a modal carousel by clicking on a picture.
				</h4>
				<h4>
          Used Technologies: Ruby on Rails, Backbone.js, Bootstrap, jQuery, AJAX, jBuilder, AWS API and more!

				This project was written to gain a better understanding of how the magic of Ruby on Rails works. By utilizing Ruby metaprogramming, some of the basic functionalities of Rails such as mass-assignment protection, creating reader and writer methods for instance variables, and the awesome power of associations were replicated.

				<h4>
				I really enjoyed this project as it allowed me to get a better understanding of how Ruby on Rails works under the hood. New technology has always been created to make things easier, but also forces you to be bound by its constraints. By knowing how it works, instead of being bound by the program, I have confidence that I can modify the boundaries or create my own.

				This is a clone of the original classic arcade game. It was written purely in javascript and html5. Object movement and collisions were all calculated using simple vector algebra. The gameplay is still very basic, but I'm looking forward to filling it out more in the future.

				This project was another clone of an original classic arcade game. However, a tron-style gameplay was also implemented that allows for two person PVP. This game was written in javascript and jQuery. This is a two-player game so grab a friend and enjoy!
